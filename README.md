### What I learned

In this challenge was the first time using the **Framer Motion** library.

I learned how to make animations when scrolling the page using the `useInView` and `useAnimationControls` hooks present in it, besides doing some animations for some other components.

I was able to understand a little of the basic concept of the library and I will definitely use it in future projects.
